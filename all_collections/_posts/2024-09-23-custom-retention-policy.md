## Overview
In this tutorial, we will cover how to create a custom retention policy using the Elasticsearch API. This
will be useful for SOC engineers who want to manage their data retention in a more flexible way.
## Prerequisites
#### **Index Selection:**
Let's assume the index for this task is called `my_fluent`.

### **Use Tines Story Development**
Hereâ€™s how to complete the task using **Tines**:
- **Create a Story in Tines**
- **Actions in Tines:**
	1. **Fetch Index Size (HTTP Request Action)**
	2. **Threshold Check (Trigger Action)**
	3. **Send Email (Email Action)**
	4. **Delete Old Logs (HTTP Request Action)**

Here is a diagram of the required workflow:

### **Action 1: Fetch Index Size**
Create an HTTP Request Action in Tines to get the index size from Elasticsearch using the `_stats` API.
**Reference**: [Elasticsearch: Indices Stats API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-stats.html)

![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/5.png)

### **Action 2: Threshold Check**
Use a **Trigger Action** in Tines to compare the fetched size of the index to the threshold (e.g., 1 MB).

![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/6.png)
![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/7.png)
![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/8.png)

If the threshold is exceeded, proceed to delete logs or take further action.

### **Action 3: Send Email**
Create an **Email Action** in Tines to send an email report with the details of the index, size, and timestamp.

![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/12.png)

**The results:**

![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/14.png)

### **Action 4: Delete Old Logs**
If the index size exceeds the threshold, you can use another **HTTP Request Action** in Tines to delete logs that are older than a certain number of days using the Elasticsearch `Delete By Query API`.
**Reference**: [Elasticsearch: Delete By Query API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-delete-by-query.html)

![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/3.png)
![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/15.png)
![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/16.png)

This will delete all logs older than 7 days.

**Response:**

### **Full Workflow Structure:**
Here is the workflow diagram for how the actions connect:

### **Use Python Script**
To implement this task using **Python**, we'll write a script that interacts with Elasticsearch via its API to:
1. **Fetch the index size**.
2. **Check if the size exceeds a threshold**.
3. **Send an email report**.
4. **Delete old logs if the threshold is exceeded**.

```python
import requests
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from datetime import datetime
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

# Elasticsearch configuration
ES_URL = "https://localhost:9200" 
INDEX = "my_fluent"
THRESHOLD_MB = 5  
ES_USERNAME = "elastic"
ES_PASSWORD = "password"

# Gmail SMTP Configuration
SMTP_SERVER = "smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT = 587
SMTP_USERNAME = "example@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD = "apppassword"  
EMAIL_FROM = "Ali"
EMAIL_TO = ["recipient@example.com"]


def fetch_index_size(index):
    url = f"{ES_URL}/{index}/_stats/store"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(ES_USERNAME, ES_PASSWORD), verify=False)  # Disable SSL certificate verification
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        size_in_bytes = data['indices'][index]['total']['store']['size_in_bytes']
        size_in_mb = size_in_bytes / (1024 * 1024)  # Convert to MB
        return size_in_mb
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error fetching index size: {e}")
        return None


def send_email_report(index_name, size_in_mb, timestamp):
    subject = "Task 2: Index Size Report"
    body = f"""
    Index Name: {index_name}
    Current Size: {size_in_mb:.2f} MB
    Checked at: {timestamp}
    """
    msg = MIMEText(body)
    msg["Subject"] = subject
    msg["From"] = EMAIL_FROM
    msg["To"] = ", ".join(EMAIL_TO)

    try:
        with smtplib.SMTP(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT) as server:
            server.starttls()
            server.login(SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD)
            server.sendmail(EMAIL_FROM, EMAIL_TO, msg.as_string())
        print("Email report sent successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {e}")


def delete_old_logs(index, days=7):
    url = f"{ES_URL}/{index}/_delete_by_query"
    query = {
        "query": {
            "range": {
                "@timestamp": {
                    "lt": f"now-{days}d/d"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, json=query, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(ES_USERNAME, ES_PASSWORD), verify=False)
        response.raise_for_status()
        result = response.json()
        print(f"Deleted {result['deleted']} documents older than {days} days.")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error deleting old logs: {e}")


def main():
    # Fetch index size
    index_size = fetch_index_size(INDEX)
    
    if index_size is None:
        print("Failed to fetch index size. Exiting.")
        return
    
    # Get the current timestamp
    timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    
    # Send the email report
    send_email_report(INDEX, index_size, timestamp)

    # Check if the size exceeds the threshold
    if index_size > THRESHOLD_MB:
        print(f"Index size exceeds the threshold of {THRESHOLD_MB} MB.")
        # Delete old logs if the threshold is exceeded
        delete_old_logs(INDEX, days=7)
    else:
        print(f"Index size is within the threshold: {index_size:.2f} MB.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
To send emails using **Gmail's SMTP server** in the Python script, you'll need to configure Gmail's SMTP settings and update the `SMTP_SERVER`, `SMTP_PORT`, and authentication variables in the script. Gmail uses **OAuth2** for secure authentication, but you can also use an **App Password** if you have **2-Step Verification** enabled for your Google account.
### **Use an App Password**:

If your account uses **2-Step Verification**, you must create an **App Password**:

- Go to Google Account Security.
- Under "Signing in to Google," enable **2-Step Verification** if it's not enabled.
- Then, generate an **App Password**.
![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/21.png)
![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/22.png)

![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/24.png)
Use this App Password instead of your regular Gmail password in the script.

I added my credentials to the script and executed it:

![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/26.png)

I tried on another index `.ds-metrics-system.network-default-2024.09.05-000001`:

![img1](/assets/images/2024-09-23-custom-retention-policy/27.png)

I updated the script to send "Pre-Deletion" and "Post-Deletion" emails:

```python
...
    # Send the email report with the current index size
    initial_email_subject = "Task 2: from pyscript"
    initial_email_body = f"""
    Index Name: {INDEX}
    Current Size: {index_size:.2f} MB
    Checked at: {timestamp}
    """
    send_email_report(initial_email_subject, initial_email_body)

    # Check if the size exceeds the threshold
    if index_size > THRESHOLD_MB:
        print(f"Index size exceeds the threshold of {THRESHOLD_MB} MB.")
        
        # Send email before deleting
        pre_deletion_subject = "Task 2: Pre-Deletion Notification"
        pre_deletion_body = f"""
        Index Name: {INDEX}
        Current Size: {index_size:.2f} MB
        Action: Deleting logs older than 7 dayss.
        """
        send_email_report(pre_deletion_subject, pre_deletion_body)
        
        # Delete old logs if the threshold is exceeded
        deleted_docs = delete_old_logs(INDEX, days=7)
        
        if deleted_docs is not None:
            # Send email after deleting
            post_deletion_subject = "Task 2: Post-Deletion Report"
            post_deletion_body = f"""
            Index Name: {INDEX}
            Logs older than 7 dayss have been deleted.
            Documents deleted: {deleted_docs}
            Current Size: {index_size:.2f} MB
            Checked at: {timestamp}
            """
            send_email_report(post_deletion_subject, post_deletion_body)
        else:
            print("Error occurred during deletion. No email sent for post-deletion.")
    else:
        print(f"Index size is within the threshold: {index_size:.2f} MB.")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
